description: Modeling defender–attacker dynamics for scraping defense
importance: 3

Professional scrapers often have better resources than data defenders. I model the protection problem as a dynamic game: defenders choose defense levels periodically while attackers optimize timing. A Markov model over breach history captures evolving deterrence dynamics and yields strategies that maximize long-term defense efficiency.
