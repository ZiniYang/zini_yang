I built an end-to-end pipeline that scans terabytes of Common Crawl to surface weak signals quickly:</p> <ul> <li>A FastText-based coarse filter runs &gt;1,000x faster than LLM classification while keeping ~60% precision.</li> <li>A locally hosted Qwen model performs fine-grained labeling with validated prompts.</li> <li>UMAP clustering plus LLM-generated summaries improve interpretability by revealing emerging discourse patterns.</li> </ul> </body></html>
