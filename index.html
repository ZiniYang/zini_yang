            We introduce the <strong>Inequality Ranking and Inference System (IRIS)</strong>, a system that quantifies and ranks mathematical
            conjectures through sharpness, diversity, difficulty, and novelty metrics. By re-engineering the GraffitiAI pipeline,
            IRIS scales conjecture evaluation and includes an automated counterexample discovery system using GNN embeddings and
            PPO-based reinforcement learning, refuting 95% of tested conjectures.

              In this project, we observed that most existing evaluation methods rely solely on explicitly defined criteria, which limits their ability to meaningfully assess LLM creativity. To address this limitation, we proposed a method that incorporates human responses to better evaluate the LLM creativity. Our approach consists of two steps: 1) we create a boundary in the embedding space by identifying the smallest convex hull that contains human responses above a density threshold; 2) we introduce the LLM coverage rate, which measures the proportion of LLM outputs that fall within this human-response-grounded boundary. Across a range of tasks, including divergent thinking, code generation, and creative writing, our method exhibited strong generalizability: the LLM coverage rate consistently decreased as tasks required more detailed and thoughtful responses. This demonstrates that our human-response-grounded framework provides a better way to evaluate LLM creativity.

             The project focuses on early detection of vaccine-related risks. Because news coverage tends to spike only after crises escalate, early warning signals buried in open-source data remain underutilized. To address this challenge, I developed an end-to-end pipeline that processes terabytes of Common Crawl data. To manage the computational scale, I implemented a FastText-based coarse filter, achieving ~60% precision while running over 1,000× faster than LLM-based classification. I then applied a locally hosted Qwen model for fine-grained labeling using carefully validated prompts and annotations. To enhance interpretability, I integrated UMAP-based clustering and LLM-generated summaries to reveal emerging discourse patterns.

              This research addresses the asymmetry where data defenders possess less advanced technology than professional
              scrapers. We formulate the protection problem as a dynamic game where protectors choose defense levels periodically
              and attackers optimize attack timing. A Markov model over breach history analyzes evolving deterrence dynamics and
              derives optimal strategies that maximize long-term defense efficiency.
