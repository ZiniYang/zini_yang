I am a master's student in Computer Science and Economics at Duke University, advised by [Dr. Emily Wenger](https://www.emilywenger.com/) in the [Argus Lab](https://arguslab.pratt.duke.edu/). My research bridges computational social science and AI systems, focusing on game theory, behavioral economics, and network science to build socially aware and trustworthy AI.

Previously, I studied mathematical economics at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics under [Prof. Simin He](https://hesimin.com/), where I worked on behavioral economics.

**Research interests**
- Social science for trustworthy AI: using game theory, behavioral economics, and network science to identify and close gaps between LLMs and human intelligence.
- AI for science and social good: leveraging AI for scientific discovery and high-impact domains such as health, emphasizing information retrieval, data mining, and simulation.
